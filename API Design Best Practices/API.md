Let’s say something about you first. If you came here from Google or from Medium itself, then — “ You are a man! You know, keep it up doing and one day you would be an Artist of your way!”

I assume that you are a mid level developer. So I don’t have to explain everything in details. But remember, the points I am going to say about designing API, contains a hell lot of information to share. I can make a series to explain it properly. To prevent making it large, I am just giving the head shots in this article.

So, Here are the main points we should keep on our head when we sit to write new APIs. They are all written in First Person because it will help me and you to take it as autosuggestion.

**1. I Use only nouns for my URI.**
**2. My GET Methods should not alter the state of my resources.**
**I Use plural nouns for my URI.**
**I Use sub-resources for relationships between resources.**
**I Use HTTP Headers to specify Input/Output format.**
**I Provide users with filtering and paging for collections.**
**I do Version my API.**
**I Provide proper HTTP status code.**
